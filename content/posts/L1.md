## EXPT1

### 1A:Observe the contents of the register
```matlab
AREA ONE, CODE, READONLY
ENTRY
MOV R0, #0X01
MOV R1, #0X02
ADD R2, R1, R0

L    B L
END

```
### 1B:transfer a block of data from source to destination
```matlab
	AREA ONE, CODE, READONLY
		ENTRY

		MOV R5, #10
		LDR R0, =FBLOCK   ; Load the address of FBLOCK into R0
		LDR R2, =SBLOCK   ; Load the address of SBLOCK into R2

LOOP	LDRH R1, [R0], #2  ; Load 2 bytes from the source (increment R0 by 2)
		STRH R1, [R2], #2  ; Store 2 bytes to the destination (increment R2 by 2)
		SUBS R5, R5, #1    ; Subtract 1 from R5
		BNE LOOP           ; Branch back to LOOP if R5 is not zero

L		B L                ; Infinite loop (useful for preventing the program from falling through)

FBLOCK DCW 0X1234, 0X5678, 0x2652, 0x1124
	AREA MYDATA, DATA, READWRITE
SBLOCK DCW 0
