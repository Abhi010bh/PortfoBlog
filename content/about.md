## Hey there,

>Exploring the learning domain, I currently, perceive my Bachelors degree in Computer Science & Engineering.
>Equiped with a decent knowledge in C, C++, Java, programming seems fun.

>Apart from the student duties,I find a way to toggle between a few hobbies. Got a knack for poetry, my brush strokes are decent too. My free time spans around movies,books and friends.
People with the zeal to be happy & create joy, inspire me. If that's you, up for a cup of Chai, are we.
